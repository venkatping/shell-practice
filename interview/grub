1. Grub and Grub2 are Bootloaders

2. Bootloaders are installed in MBR(Mater Boot Record)

3. Master Boot Record is present in first sector of the computer Hard drive

4. This Tells the computer to how to load the operation system

5. MBR is a 512 Byte sector that is the first sectore of a primary disk

6. First 446 bytes will have Bootstrap Code Area and the next 64 bytes will have partition table and remaining 2 bytes will have boot signature

MBR is less than 512 bytes in size. This has three components 1) primary boot loader info in 1st 446 bytes 2) partition table info
in next 64 bytes 3) mbr validation check in last 2 bytes.

7. Grub and Grub2 are capable of handling the boot process for multiple OSes, both can auto-load OSes

8. Grub references storage devices by their hardware address like sda1 and sda2
For example, if a drive is cloned due to hardware failure or other issues, and the new drive is installed in the system,
that hardware designation can change. Likewise, if storage devices are simply moved to different ports during maintenance,
that can change the hardware designation as well.

If the hardware designation changes for a storage device, the Grub configuration files need to be edited. Otherwise, Grub will not be able
to locate the resources needed to boot an OS.

9. Grub2 references devices by their UUID. This can improve the stability of the bootloader. It also makes the boot loader more fault-tolerant
since it can still reference the resources needed even if the hardware designation changes
